=========================

Although Lyrics Lasso is a fully functional Python script based program,
it is easiest for end users to utilize the program by running a precompiled
binary. Please see the file "setup.py" for more information on converting 
the Lyrics Lasso Python files into a precompiled binary that can be distributed.
